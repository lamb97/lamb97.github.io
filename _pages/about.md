This is liuyang's home on the web!
I come from TianJin.I am currently an undergraduate at China University of Mining and Technology.
Now I am the leader of CUBOT vision group. I have strong English reading and writing skills, along with a strong motivation for learning and communication ability. I am interested in robotics, including theoretical foundations, algorithms, and practical applications of autonomy in robots. In the futureï¼ŒI hope to develop reliable, adaptive, and efficient learning and control methods , to realize agile embodied intelligent robots, and to become a creative individual.

***I'm looking for a Intern or Visiting Students position in robotics. Please contact me if you are interested in my background and experience so long as you have an available position!***
